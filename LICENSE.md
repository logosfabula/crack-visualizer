## ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMERS

### Engineering and Structural Assessment Disclaimer

This software is provided for INFORMATIONAL and MONITORING purposes only. 

**IMPORTANT NOTICES:**

1. **Not a Substitute for Professional Engineering**: This application does NOT replace professional structural engineering assessment, inspection, or analysis by licensed professionals.

2. **Developer Qualifications**: The developer of this software is NOT a licensed structural engineer, architect, or building professional. This tool was created for data visualization and tracking purposes only.

3. **Measurement Approximations**: All calculations, measurements, and interpretations provided by this software are approximations based on mathematical models. Actual structural conditions may vary and require professional assessment.

4. **No Warranty for Structural Safety**: This software provides NO warranty, guarantee, or assurance regarding the structural safety, stability, or integrity of any building, structure, or construction element.

5. **Qualitative Analysis Only**: While this tool aims to provide accurate visualization and tracking of crack meter data, it should be considered a qualitative monitoring tool only, not a quantitative structural analysis.

6. **Professional Consultation Required**: Any concerns about structural movement, cracks, or building stability MUST be evaluated by:
   - Licensed structural engineers
   - Licensed architects
   - Qualified building inspectors
   - Other appropriate licensed professionals

7. **Liability Limitations**: Users of this software assume all risks and liability for any decisions made based on the information provided by this application. The developer assumes NO liability for any damages, injuries, or losses resulting from the use of this software.

8. **Data Accuracy**: While efforts have been made to ensure calculation accuracy, users are responsible for verifying all measurements and interpretations with professional engineering analysis.

### Recommended Use

This application is best used as:
- A supplementary monitoring tool alongside professional inspection
- A visualization aid for tracking changes over time
- An educational tool for understanding crack meter readings
- A data organization system for structural monitoring records

### When to Seek Professional Help

Immediately consult licensed structural engineers if:
- Any crack shows rapid or significant movement (>1mm change)
- New cracks appear or existing cracks expand
- Building shows signs of distress (doors/windows sticking, floor sloping, wall bulging)
- You have any concerns about structural safety

**BY USING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO THESE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS.**
