# Crack Movement Visualizer

A React-based application for visualizing and analyzing crack meter data from structural monitoring systems.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DISCLAIMERS - READ BEFORE USE

### 🚨 THIS IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING TOOL

**IMPORTANT**: This software is provided for **INFORMATIONAL and MONITORING purposes ONLY**.

- ❌ **NOT a substitute** for professional structural engineering assessment
- ❌ **Developer is NOT** a licensed structural engineer or building professional  
- ❌ **NOT intended** for making structural safety decisions
- ✅ **IS intended** as a qualitative visualization and tracking tool only

### ⚖️ Liability and Responsibility

**YOU MUST CONSULT LICENSED STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS** for any structural concerns. This software:
- Provides approximations based on mathematical models
- May not account for all structural factors
- Should never be the sole basis for structural decisions
- Comes with NO warranty for structural safety

**BY USING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU ASSUME ALL RISKS.** The developer assumes NO liability for damages, injuries, or losses resulting from use of this application.

### 👷 When to Seek Professional Help

Immediately consult licensed professionals if you observe:
- Rapid crack movement (>1mm change)
- New cracks or expanding existing cracks
- Building distress signs (stuck doors/windows, sloping floors, bulging walls)
- ANY concerns about structural safety

## Overview

This application helps monitor and visualize crack meter readings from structural monitoring systems installed on buildings. It converts 4-boundary crack meter measurements into precise position data and tracks movement patterns over time.

### Features

- 📊 **Timeline Analysis**: Track horizontal and vertical movement over time
- 🎯 **Movement Patterns**: Visualize crack position changes with trajectory arrows
- 📏 **Single Reading View**: Detailed visualization of individual measurements
- 📈 **Normalized Data**: Floor-specific corrections for consistent analysis
- 📋 **Data Tables**: Complete raw and normalized measurement history
- 📊 **Statistical Summary**: Movement rates, displacement analysis, and trends

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crack-visualizer.git
cd crack-visualizer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

## Usage

### Data Format

The application expects crack meter data in the following format:

```json
{
  "date": "2024-06-01",
  "Pianterreno": "-0.25;+0.75;+0.00;+1.00",
  "Piano 1": "+0.25;+0.00;+0.25;+0.50",
  "Piano 2": null
}
```

Where each reading is: `[up; right; down; left]` (boundary measurements in mm)

### Understanding the Measurements

- **Raw Data**: Direct calculations from crack meter readings
- **Normalized Data**: Floor-corrected coordinates for consistent analysis across floors
- **Movement Interpretation**: Based on position changes from first reading

### Floor-Specific Configurations

The system accounts for different crack meter orientations:
- **Pianterreno (P0)**: Inverted interpretation
- **Piano 1 (P1)**: Standard interpretation  
- **Piano 2 (P2)**: Inverted interpretation

## Technology Stack

- **React** 18.2.0
- **Recharts** 2.5.0 (for data visualization)
- **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN for styling)

## Mathematical Method

The application uses the intersection method described in `updated_crack_meter_method.md`:

1. Converts 4 boundary measurements to line endpoints
2. Calculates line equations for vertical and horizontal components
3. Finds intersection point (crack position)
4. Applies floor-specific normalization
5. Tracks movement relative to first reading

## Accuracy and Limitations

### ⚠️ Approximations and Limitations

This tool uses mathematical approximations and has several limitations:

1. **Measurement Precision**: Crack meters typically have ±0.1mm precision
2. **Environmental Factors**: Temperature, humidity, and vibration affect readings
3. **Installation Variations**: Meter orientation and mounting affect interpretation
4. **Calculation Approximations**: Mathematical models simplify complex structural behavior
5. **Qualitative Nature**: Best used for trend monitoring, not precise measurements

### Best Practices

- Use as a **supplementary monitoring tool** alongside professional inspection
- Track **trends over time** rather than individual measurements
- Verify significant changes with **on-site inspection**
- Maintain regular **professional structural assessments**
- Document all readings with **photos and observations**

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code

## Final Reminder

**🏗️ THIS IS A VISUALIZATION TOOL, NOT AN ENGINEERING ANALYSIS TOOL**

Always prioritize professional structural engineering assessment for:
- Building safety decisions
- Structural repairs or modifications
- Legal or insurance matters
- Any situation where structural integrity is a concern

**Your safety depends on proper professional evaluation, not software tools.**
